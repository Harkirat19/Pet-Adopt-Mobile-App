## Communication

- We will use Slack for quick updates and discussions.
- Important decisions and updates will be communicated through GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

## Meetings

- Weekly meetings will be held every Friday at 5 PM to discuss progress, blockers, and next steps.
- Any member who cannot attend must inform the group at least 24 hours in advance.

## Decision Making

- Decisions will be made collaboratively, and all members are encouraged to contribute their input.
- If consensus cannot be reached, we will use majority voting to make decisions.

## Code Review

- All code changes must be submitted via Pull Requests.
- Each Pull Request must be reviewed and approved by at least one other member before merging into the main branch.

## Conflict Resolution

- We will address conflicts directly and respectfully, focusing on the issue, not the person.
- If necessary, a mediator from the group will help resolve conflicts.

## Accountability

- Each member is responsible for their assigned tasks and must communicate any challenges they encounter.
- Members should update the status of their tasks in the project management tool (GitHub Issues).
