## Project Description
Our project focuses on developing a Pet Adoption Mobile App to connect potential adopters with animals and streamline the adoption process. The app features detailed  User registration and Profile creation, Pet profiles, Advanced search filters and Option to Chat with pet owners. Users can save favorite pets, explore matches, and post pets for adoption if they wish to give them away.


### User Registration and Profile Creation
Implement a user-friendly registration process allowing adopters to create personal profiles.
Enable users to save their preferences and receive personalized pet recommendations.

### Pet Profiles
Detailed profiles for each pet, including images, age, breed, and health status, are displayed to help potential adopters learn about the animals available for adoption. This feature allows adopters to find pets that best match their preferences and lifestyle.

### Advanced Pet Search and Filtering
Introduce advanced search filters (e.g., species, breed, age, size, location) to help users find pets that match their criteria.
Incorporate a matching algorithm to suggest pets based on user preferences.

### Post a New Pet for Adoption
Allow users to list pets they wish to put up for adoption by creating detailed profiles with images, descriptions, and health information.
Enable the option to update or remove listings as needed.

### Chat with Pet Owners
Allow users to initiate chat conversations with the pet owner directly through the app.
Provide a secure and user-friendly chat interface for communication between adopters and pet owners.

### Favorites and Wishlist
Enable users to save favorite pets to a wishlist for future reference.
Notify users if a favorited pet's status changes (e.g., adopted, pending).
