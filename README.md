## Project Description
Our project focuses on developing a Pet Adoption and Care Mobile App designed to connect potential adopters with animal shelters and streamline the adoption process. The platform allows shelters to showcase available pets, where adopters can explore pet profiles and contact the shelter if they are interested to adopt. Additionally, post-adoption care tips and resources will support adopters in providing a smooth transition for their new pets.

### Pet Profiles
Detailed profiles for each pet, including images, age, breed, and health status, are displayed to help potential adopters learn about the animals available for adoption. This feature allows adopters to find pets that best match their preferences and lifestyle.

### Interactive City Shelter Map
A map showcasing all animal shelters in the city provides users with the ability to locate shelters easily. By clicking on a shelter's location, users can view a list of animals currently available for adoption, along with their detailed profiles.

### Post-Adoption Care Guides
Adopters will have access to care guides filled with helpful information about pet care, health tips, training resources, and best practices to ensure a smooth transition for the pet into its new home.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

The frontend will be developed using React.js, leveraging its component-based architecture for building dynamic user interfaces. For styling and responsive design, Tailwind CSS will be employed to ensure a clean and modern user experience. The website will feature a Google Maps API integration to display city shelters and provide clickable markers that reveal available animals at each shelter.

### Backend

The website's backend will be powered by Node.js using the Express.js framework to efficiently handle HTTP requests and server-side logic. Real-time data storage and management will be supported through Firebase Firestore. The backend will be designed to provide scalable and fast data operations, including API endpoints for shelter and pet data management.

### Developing Tools

This website will be built using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with several extensions to enhance development like, Live Server, Prettier, etc.


Version Control: The development process will be managed using GitHub for collaborative coding and version control.


Hosting: The final hosting platform will be determined later, with potential candidates including Vercel or Firebase Hosting.
